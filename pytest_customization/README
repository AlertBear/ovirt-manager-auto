Here you can find code which allows us to run ART lib with pytest.

It is written as collection of plugins for pytest.
Thanks to pkg_resources, pytest is able to discover these plugins without
importing them into conftest.py. It allows us easier usage across test
suites.

artlib.py: Responsible to load ART_CONFIG and initalize library.
matrix.py: Generate test-classes as we used to do in ART.
           TEST x STORAGE x API Responsible to switch API & STORAGE backends.
marks.py:  Adds pytest's way to mark testcases.
           Extends junit-plugin to include polarion, bz, jira, storage,
           api fields to junit xml report.
           Added '-A' option to match attr expressions.
ssl.py: Deals with rhevm certificates.
newhooks.py: It defines new ART related hooks.
