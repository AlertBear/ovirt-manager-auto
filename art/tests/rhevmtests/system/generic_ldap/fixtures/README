This directory contains configuration of external providers.

Content of this directory:
 * conf_users.properties - store users from all providers, it's included when needed
 * conf_domains.properties - store domains from all providers, it's included when needed
 * conf_authn_*.properties - store configuration of authentication of specific provider
 * conf_authz_*.properties - store configuration of authorization of specific provider
 * provider_autn_*.properties - store configuration of authentication of specific provider module
 * provider_autz_*.properties - store configuration of authorization of specific provider module

If you want to add new external provider, please keep users and domains in appropriate file,
and keep naming convention as is, because auto test rely on this naming convention.
